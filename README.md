# Data_Analysis_Programming
This is a collaborative and interactive repository which is suggested by the course "Data Analysis Programming(DAP)". This reference describes the fundamental of Data Analysis utilizing numerous libraries such as numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn. We partially employ different strategies like KDD, SEMMA, and CRISP - DM to deploy basic forms of Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA). This includes visualizing basedata graphs, implementing mathematical operations, and handling multiple array as an engineering approach.
