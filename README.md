# Data_Analysis_Programming
This is a collaborative and interactive repository by "Data Analysis Programming(DAP)". This reference describes the fundamentals of Data Analysis utilizing numerous libraries such as numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn. We partially employ different strategies like KDD, SEMMA, and CRISP - DM to deploy basic forms of Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA). This includes visualizing base data graphs, implementing mathematical operations, and handling multiple arrays as an engineering approach.
